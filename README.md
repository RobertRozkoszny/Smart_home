###### `This is part of a smart home web app project`

This project concerns the development of a wireless smart home system using Raspberry Pi.
The system enables the user to get temperature, humidity,  light intensity and gas sensor data through a web application.
The user can access the data from the WWW connecting to the apache server running on a Raspberry Pi 3B+ functioning as 
the main node of the network. The Raspberry Pi gets measurements from arduino units equipped with sensors. 
Communication between Raspberry Pi and arduino is established using Xbee modules.
